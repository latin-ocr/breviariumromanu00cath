PREFACE.

{js-3. ,21'323'HE book now presented to liturgical students is a
Ι< reprint of the first text of the Reformed Breviary
’πῖ-Ξ of Cardinal Quignon. Copies of this first text are
very rare; doubt has been even expressed by bibliographers
whether any part of the recension had survived beyond the
few pages of the preface that are preserved in the great
Library at Paris in the Rue de Riehelieu.
This text of the Breviary was in use only from February
1535 to July 1536. During this short time there appeared at
least six editions3 to wit:

Ι. R. (Biblioteca Angelica, Rome. Ι. 9. 8.)

Breviarium Romanum Ι ex sacra potissimum Ι Scriptura
et pro Ι batis sancto Ι rum histo Ι riis con Ι stans. [In red
Roman capitals]

Roman capitals runs round; and on lowest part of page
is: MDXXXV.

The last page is taken up in great part by a woodcut of
a crowned eagle, the body between the letters A ancl B : the
claws holding a eloth: above the woodcut is: Non recedat
volumen legis Ι huius ab ore tuo. Ι sed meditaberis in eo
diebus Ι ac noctibus Ι Below is: Romae apud Antonium
