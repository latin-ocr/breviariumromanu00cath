the good offices of Messrs Ellis and Elvey, after I had given
up all hopes of tnuing the copy. 'To the cnvner of ssus

obligations for his courtesy and patient kindness in entrust-
ing his precious volume for so many months to the safe
keeping of Mr Eleus, for the purpose of so prolonged a
collation.

Dr Romolo Brigiuti was good enough to read the proofs
with the Roman edition in the Biblioteca Angelica; so that

glad to have this opportunity of thanking ΜΓ W. Bliss for
his kindness in obtaining for me admission to the Vatican
Library during my stay in Rome.

Much help has been given me by Mr Everard Green,
especially in a long and troublesome search which he. under-
took in quest of the arms of Cardinal Quignon. They are,
he tells me, as follows: Checky Gules and Vair; (Quifiones)

castles triple towered Or, in base a lion rampant of the first3

thwaite. And Ι must also add that I have been helped in
